<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    <p>I was born in Kolding in Denmark, and grew up on a pig farm with my mom, dad and my little brother. I had a wonderful upbringing, full of love and good memories of working in the fields and driving the tractors almost from when I could reach the pedals (don't tell anyone). Growing up in the country is something I cherish very much, and has taught me good work ethics and that hard work pays off because nothing comes free.</p>
  <br />
    <p>In late 2000 my mother dies suddenly of a brain aneurysm, and everything changed. I was 17, about to finish primary school and now questioning life after this tragedy. So I went 6 months away from home to take a semester in IT at Snoghøj IT Højskole near Fredericia, where the focus was more hardware and networks than software. It was the best decision I could have made, and it really re-sparked my interest in computers and technology, as well as got my attention away from losing my mom, and it gave me a sense of purpose.</p>
    <br />
    <p>After school I was not too sure what I wanted to do yet, so coming from a hardworking family, and seeing my dad had gotten a full time job in the warehouse industry, I did the same and worked for close to 9 years full time driving forklifts and operating cranes. In my spare time I started to teach myself programming in C#, and making little apps, I also got some servers up and running to play around with and to host my own websites and I just felt like this is what I want to do with my life! Then I finally took the step to go back to school to get my high school diploma and then my computer science degree.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I absolutely have a passion for programming and software development. After teaching myself C# during one year, I fell in love with the language and it’s possibilities! I am always working hard in and outside of work, learning different technologies, and building projects to expand my horizon. I have been working full time for over 5 years now, and I absolutely love it!.</p>

<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
  <p>I love to spend time with my family, or tinker with programming, servers, 3D printing and electronics. Sometimes I will combine a lot of them and play around building some IoT project using Raspberry Pi or other platforms.</p>
